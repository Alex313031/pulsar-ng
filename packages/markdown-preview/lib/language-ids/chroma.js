/*
 * This Document defines the Language Identifiers for 'Chroma'
 * That is the string used after a code block delimiter to define
 * what programming language is within the code block.
 *
 * 'Chroma' is the Syntax Highlighting Engine used by Codeberg/Gitea/Hugo within
 * the Goldmark Markdown rendering engine:
 * https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
 *
 * This file can be updated here:
 * https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/tree/master/lexers
 * Where each Lexer is able to define its name, and aliases within its exported
 * Config type. Otherwise the name of the lexer file is used.
